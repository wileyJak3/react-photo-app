## Challenges
There were plenty of styling hurdles to get over during the creation of Senna to create a social media application with a genuine look and feel. Manipulating state for components and being able to update the bookmarked section in real-time and using context to store the changes throughout the project.

Also had a major git hub bug when I tried to force a commit when time was dwindling down for my project. I managed to force the commit trying to recover the data I lost but it removed my commits, included in the read me is the master record of my commits I found sifting through the trash of my computer. I included it as an file called master.md and it shows the 76 commits I had prior to the bug. I hope this suffice as evidence because this was all I could find and I truly don't kow what happened.
